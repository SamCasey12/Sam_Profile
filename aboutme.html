      <h2>About Myself</h2>
		  <p>Hello, My name is Sam Casey, and I live in Glenflesk, Killarney, County Kerry. I am currently completing a computer games design course at Kerry College Tralee. I have always had a passion for technology and creativity, and game design is the perfect field to bring these two elements together.

	As a student, I am dedicated and motivated to learn as much as possible in my chosen field. I take my studies seriously and always strive to improve my skills and techniques. I enjoy collaborating with my classmates and contributing to team projects, using my attention to detail and creative thinking to achieve the best possible results.

	When I'm not studying, I like to explore the beautiful countryside of County Kerry, taking in the stunning scenery and enjoying outdoor activities like hiking and biking. I am also a keen football fan and enjoy following my favorite team. Spending time with my family and friends is also important to me, and I always welcome the opportunity to learn about new cultures and experiences.

	In summary, I believe that my passion, work ethic, and creativity will take me far in my future career as a game designer. I am excited to see where my studies and hard work will lead me and look forward to making a positive impact in the industry..</p>
		  <p>Studying games design has been an incredible journey for me. The course at Kerry College Tralee has provided me with a deep understanding of the technical and artistic aspects of game development, as well as the creative storytelling needed to engage players.

	Through the course, I have gained experience in various game engines, programming languages, and design principles. I have been able to put my skills into practice by developing my own games and working on collaborative projects with other students. This has helped me to understand the challenges and rewards of working in a team and to appreciate the different skills and perspectives each team member brings.

	What I love about this course is the constant challenge it presents me. I am always learning new techniques and exploring different ideas, which keeps the work exciting and rewarding. I also appreciate the emphasis on creative problem-solving and critical thinking, as these skills will be invaluable in my future career.

	The support I have received from my tutors has been fantastic. They are always available to offer guidance and advice, and their experience in the industry has given me a glimpse of what my future career may hold. The course has also allowed me to connect with like-minded individuals who share my passion for games design, and I have made lasting friendships through our shared experiences.

	Overall, this course has provided me with a solid foundation in games design and has opened up a world of opportunities for me. I am excited to see where my skills and knowledge will take me in the future and am grateful for the education and support I have received at Kerry College Tralee.</p>
